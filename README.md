# Final Project

### For this project, we wanted to explore the correlation between poverty and drinking water quality in the US. We do this by gathering census data from the Federal Census Database and relating it to data gathered from the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System.

### We gather the data from calls to each api, clean and organize, and store it as a SQL database for convenient examination and manipulation.

### To explore the correlation between this data, we use a Seaborn heatmap and Unsupervised Machine Learning and PyTorch Neural Network for regression.

### Here is a Data Model for the SQL database we created:
